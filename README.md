    4. Similar Web Sites:
        1. https://www.ubuy.com.ro/en/

            PROs:
            * The products gallery is very nicely stylized : boxes with round corners,
        medium images, making the phones easy to see.
            * The content is being loaded dynamically, presenting the user
        with some nice content loading loops, instead of showing a blank page.

            CONs:
            * The text under the products in the gallery is not organized very well,
        it tries to fit as much information in a very small space, making it look
        very dense and hard to read.
        2. https://www.samsungmobilestore.ro/

            Observations:
            * The content is well organized using the header,
        being able to easily select between tablets/phones/wearables/accessories
        because there aren't too many categories of products.
            * The user experience is straight-forward, showing some of the deals
        on the same page.
        3. https://www.quickmobile.ro/

            Observations:
            * The site doesn't have enough filtering options beside
        some basic sorting functionalities by price, making it difficult
        for the user to find a better choice.

        4. https://www.mobileshop.eu/ro/

            Observations:
            * The user is welcomed with multiple banners and carousels,
        displaying the top & newest offers to the user inciting him to start buying.
            * The main page header is divided in multiple categories,
        and it also contains a search bar to facilitate product searching.

        Overall observations:
        * The sites mentioned above all use pagination in order to display their
    products on the page.
        * The menu & contact info along with many links to other pages and infos
    are present in the header & footer.
3. Website Chromatic Schema Used

    Using the [Adobe Color Tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
    I chose the website's main color to be
    <span style="color: #5AAAFA">
        #5AAAFA
    </span>
    and by using the Shades option I picked similar colors around the main one.
    To be more specific, the chromatic schema that I chose is represented
    by the following colors:
    * A: <span style="color: #437FBA">#437FBA</span>
    * B: <span style="color: #2C537A">#2C537A</span>
    * C: <span style="color: #5AAAFA">#5AAAFA</span> <- Main Color
    * D: <span style="color: #15283B">#15283B</span>
    * E: <span style="color: #5199E0">#5199E0</span>

    The reasons as to why I chose these specific combinations include the following:
      * Because the website is technology based, I chose to go with a colder
    set of colors around blue.
      * This color set should be more pleasing to the human eye than a bright
    red or a blinding yellow.
      * The products can have many different specifications and subtleties,
    and the user might stay a while on the page. Because of this, the
    chromatic schema should not provoke eye strain.
      * Also, from a psychological view standpoint, color shades around blue should
    give the user a sense of safety and calmness which will provide an
    undisruptive environment during their stay.
