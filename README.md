    4. Similar Web Sites:
        1. https://www.ubuy.com.ro/en/

            PROs:
            * The products gallery is very nicely stylized : boxes with round corners,
        medium images, making the phones easy to see.
            * The content is being loaded dynamically, presenting the user
        with some nice content loading loops, instead of showing a blank page.

            CONs:
            * The text under the products in the gallery is not organized very well,
        it tries to fit as much information in a very small space, making it look
        very dense and hard to read.
        2. https://www.samsungmobilestore.ro/

            Observations:
            * The content is well organized using the header,
        being able to easily select between tablets/phones/wearables/accessories
        because there aren't too many categories of products.
            * The user experience is straight-forward, showing some of the deals
        on the same page.
        3. https://www.quickmobile.ro/

            Observations:
            * The site doesn't have enough filtering options beside
        some basic sorting functionalities by price, making it difficult
        for the user to find a better choice.

        4. https://www.mobileshop.eu/ro/

            Observations:
            * The user is welcomed with multiple banners and carousels,
        displaying the top & newest offers to the user inciting him to start buying.
            * The main page header is divided in multiple categories,
        and it also contains a search bar to facilitate product searching.

        Overall observations:
        * The sites mentioned above all use pagination in order to display their
    products on the page.
        * The menu & contact info along with many links to other pages and infos
    are present in the header & footer.
